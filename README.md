# Elevator Control System

A production-ready elementary elevator control system built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This system demonstrates clean architecture, intelligent dispatch algorithms, and real-time simulation capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è System Requirements

**Building Configuration:**
- 10 floors
- 4 elevators
- 10 seconds movement time per floor
- 10 seconds loading/unloading time per stop

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Intelligent Dispatch Algorithm**: Implements up/down logic with optimal elevator assignment
- **Real-time Simulation**: Automatic random call generation with configurable intervals
- **Console Logging**: Comprehensive system event logging as required
- **Interactive UI**: Manual floor call buttons and system controls

### Technical Excellence
- **Clean Architecture**: Service layer, factory patterns, and separation of concerns
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict typing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and validation
- **Performance**: Optimized state management and efficient algorithms
- **Responsive Design**: Cross-browser compatible, mobile-friendly interface
- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests for core business logic

### Algorithm Implementation
- **Up/Down Logic**: Elevators continue in their direction until no more passengers
- **Optimal Assignment**: Scoring system for best elevator selection
- **Direction Continuity**: Prevents yo-yo behavior between floors
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes calls across available elevators

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## üéØ Usage

1. **Start Simulation**: Click "Start Simulation" for automatic random calls
2. **Manual Calls**: Use up/down buttons on each floor
3. **Monitor Activity**: View real-time logs and elevator status
4. **System Metrics**: Track performance and utilization

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

### Service Layer
- `ElevatorControlService`: Main business logic orchestration
- `ElevatorDispatcher`: Core dispatch algorithm implementation
- `ElevatorFactory`: Object creation and validation

### UI Components
- `ElevatorShaft`: Building visualization with interactive controls
- `ElevatorStatus`: Real-time elevator state monitoring
- `ActivityLog`: System event logging with filtering
- `ControlPanel`: Simulation controls and metrics

### State Management
- Custom React hook (`useElevatorSystem`) for state integration
- Immutable state updates with proper error handling
- Real-time updates with efficient re-rendering

## üß™ Testing

The system includes comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Dispatch algorithm logic
- Edge cases and error conditions
- State management operations
- Factory method validation

```bash
npm run test          # Run tests once
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run with coverage report
```

## üìä System Metrics

The system tracks and displays:
- System uptime
- Total calls processed
- Pending calls count
- Active/idle elevator status
- Real-time performance data

## üé® Design Principles

### Code Quality
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, dependency injection
- **Clean Code**: Meaningful names, small functions, clear comments
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user feedback
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms and optimized rendering

### User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear status indicators and animations
- **Intuitive Controls**: Self-explanatory interface elements

## üîß Configuration

System constants can be modified in `lib/constants.ts`:

```typescript
export const SYSTEM_CONFIG = {
  BUILDING: {
    FLOORS: 10,
    ELEVATOR_COUNT: 4,
  },
  TIMING: {
    MOVE_DURATION_MS: 10000,
    LOADING_DURATION_MS: 10000,
  },
  // ... additional configuration
};
```

## üìù Console Logging

As required, all system events are logged to the console with timestamps:

```
[10:30:15] Floor 5 up call assigned to Elevator 2
[10:30:25] Elevator 2 moving up from floor 1 to floor 5
[10:30:35] Elevator 2 arrived at floor 5
[10:30:35] Elevator 2 loading passengers at floor 5
```

## üöÄ Production Considerations

This implementation demonstrates production-ready patterns:
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Performance optimization and memory management
- Scalable architecture for future enhancements
- Proper separation of concerns
- Extensive documentation and testing

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development Notes

Built with modern web technologies and best practices:
- **Next.js 13+**: App router and server components
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing and interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Vitest**: Modern testing framework
- **Clean Architecture**: Maintainable and extensible codebase
